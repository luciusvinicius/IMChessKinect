# How to run

First open the IM command line file and execute:
```
java -jar mmiframeworkV2.jar
```

Secondly, open Kinect Studio, open the corect `.xef` file to simulate the kinect without having one, and click on "connect".

Lastly, open the executable on the "./kinect" folder to sync the input with the IM.

Now you IM is linked to the kinect, and you can open the AppGui as usual
